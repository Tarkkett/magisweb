  headline: About us
  title: Let us introduce ourselves..
  description: It all began with a group of kids in their early teens, brought together by parents who initiated a youth robotics team engaging in LEGO robots. The team's journey continued, culminating in a trip to Houston, Texas, for the global FLL event in 2022, where they won the Robot Design Award. Shortly after, 5 current team members participated in First Global Challenge and became the Winning Alliance in fall of 2022. Following this achievement, the original, the original team saw an opportuity for growth, transitioning into FTC and expanding into a thriving robotics community. In 2024 the original team "Lituanica X" bacame so big, that it had to split into multiple smaller teams. Later that year, members of two of those teams formed another team - MAGIS. We embraced the opportunity to collaborate as a larger group, combining our strengths and learning to work as one team. Our success lies in having not only seasoned veterans from previous competitions, but also mentors with expertise in all fields.
